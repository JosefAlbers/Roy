# Roy

[Open in Colab]

Roy is a lightweight alternative to `autogen`, for crafting advanced multi-agent systems using language models.

## Features

- Flexibility: Roy is model-agnostic, eliminating the need for external API keys. By default, it employs the 4-bit quantized wizard-coder-python, but you can swap it out for any LLM of your choice.

- Composability: Roy refines the LLM interactions into modular, adaptable operations, each of which can be used in isolation or composed in myriad ways to create sophisticated workflows.

- Clarity: Opposed to frameworks that entangle operations behind multiple layers, Roy is transparent. Each method serves a distinct purpose, for instance, granting users complete oversight and control over the process.

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JosefAlbers/Roy
cd Roy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
from roy import Roy
roy = Roy()
```

### **Template-Based Generation**

```python
s = 'Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.'
s = roy.format(s)
s = roy.generate(s)
```

### **Retrieval Augmented Generation**

```python
s = 'Create a text to image generator.'
r = roy.retrieve(s, n_topk=3, src='huggingface')
r = roy.format('Modify the [Example Code] to fulfill the [User Request] using minimal changes...', r)
[roy.generate(s) for s in r]
```

### **Auto Feedback**

```python
s = 'Find arxiv papers that show how are people studying trust calibration in AI based systems'
for i in range(3):
    c = roy.generate(s)
    s += c
    s += roy.execute(c)
```

### **Auto Grind**

```python
def auto_grind(user_request):
    cache = {'user_request': user_request, 'py_code': roy.generate(user_request)}
    for i in range(3):
        cache['sh_out'] = roy.execute(cache['py_code'])
        if 'Error' in cache['sh_out']:
            feedback = roy.format('Debug the Code ("script.py") that had been written for this problem: "{user_request}"\n\n[Code]:\n```python\n{py_code}\n```\n\n[Error]:\n{sh_out}', cache)
            cache['py_code'] = roy.generate(feedback)
        else:
            break
    return cache

auto_grind("Plot a chart of TESLA's stock price change YTD and save to 'stock_price_ytd.png'.")
```

## Self-Organizing Multi-Agent System

Envision a dynamic group chat where agents, each bearing distinct roles and defined by its unique constraints, affinities, and behaviors, converge to collaborates towards a predefined objective. This opens up a realm of possibilities, from brainstorming sessions to problem-solving think tanks. Drawing inspiration from biology and machine learning, Roy aspires to pioneer a perpetually evolving multi-agent environment.

### Survival of the Fittest

Guided by the tenets of natural selection, this principle ensures the survival of only the most adept agents:

- **Fitness Metrics**: Evaluate agents based on information quality, response speed, relevance, and feedback.
  
- **Agent Evaluation**: Periodically assess agent performance.
  
- **Agent Reproduction**: Allow top-performing agents to spawn new ones with similar attributes.
  
- **Agent Removal**: Phase out underperformers to uphold quality.
  
- **Adaptive Learning**: Agents evolve through their interactions.
  
- **Dynamic Environment**: The chat setting adapts, pushing agents to be resilient and versatile.

### Mixture of Experts

This principle promotes efficiency by allocating tasks to the most qualified agents:

- **Expertise Definition**: Designate areas of expertise for each agent.
  
- **Dynamic Collaboration**: Align relevant agents to address specific tasks.
  
- **Expert Evaluation**: Constantly gauge the performance of expert agents.
  
- **Expert Refinement**: Retrain, adjust, or replace underperforming experts.
  
- **Learning from Peers**: Agents expand their knowledge horizons by learning from others.
  
- **Task Routing**: Route tasks to the best-suited experts.
  
- **Layered Expertise**: Deploy coordinators to guide collaborations for intricate tasks.
  
- **Human Expert Integration**: Infuse human knowledge into the chat, amplifying collective intelligence.

By utilizing these principles, our self-organizing chat group remains in a state of perpetual evolution, always questing for the zenith of outcomes and ongoing enhancement.
